# Pet Fix! Web MVC

## Mission Statment
```
I am creating a Pet Rental Web MVC.  My thought is that many people would enjoy renting a pet for the day. 
Some people do not have the ability to foster animals until they are adopted. 
Perhaps they just need a day to relax with a cuddly friend.  
This would allow animals in Humane Societies to also stretch their legs for an extended period of time.  
The target audience is animal lovers. I chose this because I think this could actually be an idea that companies could bring to life.  
I want to write the code for it. 
```
## Pet Fix!
```
I have created a few data tables to help navigate and arrange the application.  
I use Pets as the "product" and my customers are able to rent them using our application. 
I do require logins, so customers must register before being able to rent a pet.  I also use a transactions section, for management.  
They can see the estimated cost of a rental, and the actual cost generated once the pet is returned.  
Though it is broken into two separate transactions, they both live on the same page, for simplicity.  
I also have created a pet photo gallery.  This can be used by management, as well as customers.  
The idea is to be able to upload photos of the pets being rented, and having a great time with their temporary friends.  
There is so much more that I would love to do on this project, and I am very pleased how far it has come in such a short amount of time.

I neeeded to come up with an idea for an application that used a minimum of 3 custom data tables with a minimum of one foreign key relationship.
Create a wireframe of the application and review it with an instructor
Build out an n-tier structured MVC with the following tiers
Data: This layer houses my classes that relate to the DB (POCOs, Identity, etc).
Models: This layer houses my reusable models for the rest of the layers.
Services: A layer where most of my heavy backend logic will be.
WebMVC: This is where the front end (Controllers, Views, Styles, etc) will be.
